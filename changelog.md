### Next release: 0.11.0.0

* [#195](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/195) Allow for conditional mediation during registration.
  Unlike the rest of this library, which strictly follows the L2 version of this spec, this feature is defined
  in the [L3 draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-3/#sctn-validating-origin). However conditional create
  greatly reduces to barrier to entry for users to use passkeys we decided to include this feature in this
  library early.

### Next release: 0.10.1.0

* [#187](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/187) Implement monotonicTime in MonadTime to resolve build-time warning

### 0.10.0.0

* [#184](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/184) Pass a list of allowed origins instead of a single origin.
  This is a breaking change needed for allowing native apps to use WebAuthn. It is also needed for Relying Parties
  that want to allow multiple subdomains to access WebAuthn credentials.
  Unlike the rest of this library, which strictly follows the L2 version of this spec, this feature is defined
  in the [L3 draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-3/#sctn-validating-origin). However because WebAuthn on
  Native Apps is widely deployed through the push of Passkeys we decided to include this feature in this library early.


### 0.9.0.0

* [#182](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/182) Migrate to the crypton library ecosystem.
  crypton is a hard fork of cryptonite, which was no longer maintained.
  Minimum version bounds have been bumped accordingly.
* Restore GHC 8.8 compatibility.

### 0.8.0.0

* [#178](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/178) Remove orphan instance for ToJSON ByteString.
  Use newtypes for the binary data including the PNG icons for authenticators and the cryptographic values.

### 0.7.0.0

* [#174](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/174) Correctly verify packed
  attestation when the AAGUID extension of the certitificate is missing. This is
  a backwards-incompatible change for packed attestation responses that
  previously failed due to the missing AAGUID extension. These responses now
  succeed.

### 0.6.0.1

* [#167](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/167) Fix missing file from sdist for testing

### 0.6.0.0

* [#163](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/163) Fix build with mtl-2.3

### 0.5.0.1

* [#159](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/159) Allow mtl-2.3.1 and support GHC 9.4

### 0.5.0.0

* [#157](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/157) Add support for the [credProps](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-authenticator-credential-properties-extension) extension
* [#158](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/158) Update root certificates

### 0.4.1.2
* [#155](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/155) Increase cabal bounds for aeson and monad-time to support latest versions from Hackage

### 0.4.1.1
* [#153](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/153) Increase cabal bounds to support up to GHC 9.2

### 0.4.1.0

* [#148](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/148) Allow authentication on Safari even though it violates the specification with an empty user handle
* [#149](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/149) Export constructors for `Crypto.WebAuthn.Encoding.WebAuthnJson` types and derive `FromJSON` for all of them
* [#151](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/151) Fix decoding of packed attestations without a `x5c` CBOR key. This fixes attestation on MacBook Pros with Chrome and TouchID.

### 0.4.0.0

* [#129](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/129) Rename and expand
  documentation for authentication/registration errors.
* [#136](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/136) Improve the safety and
  remove duplication of the public key interface. More checks are being done
  now, preventing invalid public keys from being constructed.
* [#140](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/140) Introduction of new
  serialization-related modules, all reexported via `Crypto.WebAuthn`:
  - `Crypto.WebAuthn.Model.Defaults` for defaults of optional fields
  - `Crypto.WebAuthn.Encoding.Strings` for string serializations of enumerations
  - `Crypto.WebAuthn.Encoding.Binary` for binary serializations
* [#140](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/140) Backwards-incompatible
  changes/fixes regarding serialization:
  - Fix unknown `AuthenticatorTransport` values being ignored. This breaks
    backwards compatibility when the received `AuthenticatorTransport`s are
    inspected and stored in the database. Users are encouraged to serialize
    individual `AuthenticatorTransport`s to strings using the new
    `encodeAuthenticatorTransport`. The [example
    server](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/tree/master/server) has been
    updated to store all encoded `AuthenticatorTransport`s as a CBOR-encoded
    bytestring in the database, but other schemes to store multiple transports
    can also be employed.
  - Rename webauthn-json decoding/encoding functions to have a "wj" prefix like
    `wjEncodeCredentialOptionsRegistration`. The types they interact with have
    changed their prefix from `IDL` to `WJ` as well
  - Introduce `wjDecodeCredentialRegistration'` (with a tick) to take a
    `SupportedAttestationStatementFormats` argument, while the unticked version
    doesn't take such an argument anymore. In the future only the unticked
    version is expected to stay backwards-compatible.
  - `ccdCrossOrigin`s type was corrected from `Bool` to `Maybe Bool`, where
    `Nothing` has the same semantics as `Just False`. This is necessary for
    compatibility with WebAuthn Level 1 clients, which don't set this field


### 0.3.0.0

* [#125](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/125) Some small metadata type
  simplifications involving `msUpv` and `SomeMetadataEntry`
* [#126](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/126) Decrease lower bounds of
  many dependencies including `base`, adding compatibility with GHC 8.8

### 0.2.0.0

* [#115](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/115) Increase the upper bound
  of the supported Aeson versions, allowing the library to be built with Aeson
  2.0. Drop the deriving-aeson dependency.
* [#117](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/117) Rename and expand
  documentation for attestation statement format errors. Some unused errors
  were removed.

### 0.1.1.0

* [#111](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/111) Support the
  [`transports`](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#dom-authenticatorattestationresponse-transports-slot)
  field, allowing servers to store information from the browser on how
  authenticators were communicated with (e.g. internal, NFC, etc.). When users
  log in, this information can then be passed along in [Credential
  Descriptors](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#dictdef-publickeycredentialdescriptor),
  ensuring that only the transports initially registered as supported by the
  authenticator may be used. This is recommended by the standard.
* [#112](https://github.com/tweag/webauthn/pull/112) Decrease lower bounds for
  aeson and unordered-containers.
